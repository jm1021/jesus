## Picture / Intro
> "Adam and Eva" were members of the Sabre Springs Ward.  My first memory of Eva was how she boldly declared her love for "Jesus Christ" in our Chapel.   Later, I spent time as their ministering brother and enjoyed this couples amazing commitment to the Gospel of Jesus.  Now she is an artist and the live on the East coast.

> Jesus prepares for his ministry.
- [Luke 4:1–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng&id=1-21#p1) 
- [Matthew 4:1-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?lang=eng&id=1-17#p1)

### Jesus prepares Fasts and Communes with God.  Ponder how the scriptures can build your faith and your resolve to resist temptation.

> Ponderize #1.  What is our personal take away?
- Luke 4:1 And Jesus being ***full of the Holy Ghost*** returned from Jordan, and was ***led by the Spirit into the wilderness***
- Matthew 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness ***to be tempted of the devil***.
- JST Matthew 4:1  Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit, into the wilderness, ***to be with God***.

> Ponderize #2. Think about preparing for for big events in our lives.
- Luke 4:9 ***And he brought him to Jerusalem***, and ***set him on a pinnacle of the temple***, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:   ... 10  For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:   ...   11  ***And in their hands they shall bear thee up***, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
- Mathew 4:5 ***Then the devil taketh him up*** into the holy city, and ***setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple*** ...  6  And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: ***and in their hands they shall bear thee up***, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
- JST Matthew 4:5 ***Then Jesus was taken up*** into the holy city, ***and the Spirit setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple***.   ...   6  Then the devil came unto him and said, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, ***and in their hands they shall bear thee up***, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

> Ponderize #3  Have you had turn away from things of the world for your faith?
- Luke 4:5 ***And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain***, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.   ...   6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.   ...   7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
- Matthew 4:8 Again, ***the devil taketh him up*** into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;  ... 9 aAnd saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
- JST Matthew 4:8 And again, ***Jesus was in the Spirit***, and it taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them   ...   9  And the devil came unto him again, and said, All these things will I give unto thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

> Summary thoughts.  There are many of other faiths we often see praying, reciting rituals, meditating.  Where is your private place?  How does the spirit speak to you as you pray or even commune with God.

### Jesus speaks of his mission Luke 4:16-32
> Jesus speaks of his mission.  Lets watch some of the video and follow along in Luke 4.
- Video from [The Chosen ~25:00](https://www.byutv.org/the-chosen?player-open=true&content-id=0dadaa9f-3a84-415b-ac5e-dbb7c42ea7b7)  What is proclaimed by Jesus?  How is it perceived/
- [Isaiah 61:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/61?lang=eng&id=1-2#p1)
- [Luke 4:16-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng&id=16-32#p16)

> Summary thoughts.  What insights did you gain by following the scriptures and observing an enactment? 

### The Word
> Another reading after this experience with "the Chosen".   IMO, this enactment of Luke 4 helps me understand other scriptures more clearly. 

- [John 1:1-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p12#p1)
    - 1 In the beginning was the Word, and ***the Word was with God***, and the Word was God.
    - 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
    - 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made
    - 4 ***In him was life***; and the life was the light of men.
    - 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and ***the darkness comprehended it not***.
    - 6 ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
    - 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
    - 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
    - 9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
    - 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
    - 11 He came unto his own, ***and his own received him not***.
    - 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
- [JST, John 1:1-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-john/1?lang=eng&id=p1-p12#p1)
    - 1 In the beginning was the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was the word, ***and the word was with the Son, and the Son was with God, and the Son was of God***.
    - 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
    - 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made which was made.
    - 4 ***In him was the gospel***, and the gospel was the life, and the life was the light of men;
    - 5 And the light shineth in the world, and ***the world perceiveth it not***.
    - 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
    - 7 The same came into the world for a witness, to bear witness of the light, to bear record of the gospel through the Son, unto all, that through him men might believe.
    - 8 He was not that light, but came to bear witness of that light,
    - 9 Which was the true light, which lighteth every man who cometh into the world;
    - 10 ***Even the Son of God. He who was in the world***, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
    - 11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
    - 12 But as many as received him, ***to them gave he power to become the sons of God***; only to them who believe on his name.


### Paralytic man and Sins are forgiven
> The all encompassing process of the Savior!  What is ***heal***?  Physical miracles last for a time, forgiving of sins is an ***eternal miracle***.  What is Jesus teaching?

- [Luke 5:16-26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/5?lang=eng&id=p16-p26#p16
)
    - 16 ¶ And ***he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed***.
    - 17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judæa, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
    - 18 ¶ And, behold, men brought in a bed ***a man which was taken with a palsy***: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
    - 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and ***let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus***.
    - 20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, ***thy sins are forgiven thee***.
    - 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
    - 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
    - 23 ***Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk***?
    - 24 But ***that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins***, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, ***Arise, and take up thy couch***, and go into thine house.
    - 25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
    - 26 And ***they were all amazed***, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, ***We have seen strange things to day***.

> Is there experiences of Physical or Spiritual miracles?  Any stories from the week in the form of "Reach out to Rescue"?
- [Rescue in Unity](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/10/rescue-in-unity?lang=eng&id=p9-p13#p9) using [Mark 2:1-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2?lang=eng&id=p1-p12#p1)
- They brought him up to the roof. Assuming there was no outside staircase for them to climb, it would have taken them quite some time to get everyone onto the roof. I think it might have happened this way: the young man from his ward would have climbed up to the roof first. As he was young and full of energy, it would not have been too difficult for him. His home teaching companion from the elders quorum and the tall and strong full-time missionary would have pushed really hard from below. The Relief Society sister would have reminded them to be careful and given them words of encouragement. The men would then uncover the roof while the sister continued to comfort the man as he waited to be healed—to be able to move by himself and to be free.
- This rescue assignment needed everyone working together. At the crucial moment, it would take careful coordination to lower the man with palsy from the roof. The four people would have to work in unity and in harmony. There could not be any discord among the four. They would have to lower the man with palsy at the same pace. If someone released the rope faster than the other three, the man would fall out of his bed. He could not hold on by himself due to his weakened condition.
- In order to assist the Savior, we have to work together in unity and in harmony. Everyone, every position, and every calling is important. We have to be united in our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Finally, the sick, palsied man was laid before Jesus. “When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee” (Mark 2:5). Jesus showed mercy on him and healed him—not only physically but also spiritually: “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” Isn’t that wonderful? Wouldn’t we like that to happen to all of us too? Certainly I would.
- Do we know anyone in our life who is afflicted with spiritual palsy, someone who just cannot come back to the Church by himself or herself? He or she could be one of our children, one of our parents, a spouse, or a friend.
