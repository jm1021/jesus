Bednar taught: “We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us everything we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end.

Lord speaks to people according to their own understanding | As we study, understand the story line, characters, events | In our home study, learn from each other, cater lesson to our family (younger/older children like stories) | Prepare something from home study, bring that to Sunday School, take pressure off of Sunday School Teacher | Make Christ the center of our study | We learn when do | . New Testament Chronology . There is no editor of the New Testament. No one sat down an wrote it or compiled it as a single book; It is a collection. As we study … Why did it happen? Think abut history. How does it apply to me, my family today? Enquire and ponder to enable it to lead to our sacred grove, learn for ourself. . M-M-L-J … Life of Christ, Life of Christ, Life of Christ, Life of Christ | Acts … History | Letters/Epistles … Instructions to people at the time | Revelations … Prophetic | . Genealogies from Old to New Testament . We all like to explore learning differently. These last few weeks, after a year of Old Testament study, and so many open questions about authors, dates, and theories of man … I have been very interested in dates correlating genealogies in the Old and New Testament according to science, geological, and sensational theorists. In pondering sensationalized knowledge, particularly in thinking about history of man and world, I think about the Temple Ceremony, I think about the restoration of the Gospel, and I believe God is right!!! That all truth and wisdom comes from Heavenly Father. . . Abraham is probably the 1st figure in the Old Testament where the generational authors may have had stories that were told to them by living persons, as many of the people lived to be 130 years old according to Exodus. . . Moses is considered the author of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers. . Well known, as we studied these Prophets … Abraham fathered Isaac (Gen. 21:1-3), | Isaac fathered Jacob (Gen. 25-21-26), | Jacob had 12 sons, including Levi (Gen. 35:23) | . | Lessor known, as we don’t think of these generations as prophets until Moses … Levi had three sons, including Kohath (Exo. 6:16). And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. | Kohath had four sons, including Amram (Exo. 6:18). And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. | Amram had two sons – Aaron and Moses (Exo. 6:20). And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. | . | . Transitioning to the New Testament, we find the genealogies of Christ from Luke and Mathew. These tell us how confusing records can be, when retold by authors after large periods of time. Worthy of note, Moses is from Levi and Christ is from Judah. . . Modern geological dating of Younger Dryas and Mat layer calculate 12,600 year ago. This seems really plausible for Adam, particularly when you study bible theorists. Though, pure biblical genealogies only takes us back 6,000 years But, none of this really matters to us spiritually. But, as we transition to biblical times, we have authors of the four Gospels recording most of their record 20 to 50 years after the events occurred. . Techniques to learn things of the Sprit . To transition to the New Testament, we need to have our Head, Body, and Spirit in a learning, seeking, finding condition. This is true for all gospel study.

This Christmas season our hope and prayer is that each of us will feel the unconditional love of the Savior and recognize the precious eternal gift of His Atoning sacrifice. . Our desire as a Stake Presidency is that every member of our congregations will feel the power and influence of communion with God, that we may all know that we are His children and that we will personally feel His love. “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God” (Romans 8:16). . We invite all to create an atmosphere and opportunity to allow the spirit to bear witness that we are His children. We encourage all members to individually or as family, before leaving home to attend Christmas Day Sacrament service, to kneel in humble prayer and plead with God that He might touch our hearts with the realization that He loves us and that our hearts may be open to hear and receive His spirit. . Like the petition in the well-known Christmas Hymn “Away in a Manger” we might prayerfully ask, - Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay - Close by me forever and love me I pray. . As you take these steps you will feel the Holy Spirit testifying of the divinity of Jesus Christ and will feel a closer connection to Him. You will give our Savior the gift that He seeks on Christmas Day – a closer relationship with Him. . We love you!

Less Conspicuous Gifts I am grateful for the matchless gift of His Son—a Son who came to earth as a baby, swaddled by a young mother and laid in a manger. A baby who would learn line upon line and grow grace for grace until He laid down His life as an offering for my sins. For your sins. For the sins of all who have ever lived and will ever live on the earth. . Transition Old Testament to New Testament . Imagine a time before knowing about a Savior. Imagine challenges in life and not being able to lean on the Atonement. In that journey people like us would likely be following a Faith and a Hope. . The Old Testament carries a spirit of eager anticipation. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with hope for renewal and deliverance by the Messiah. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (Isaiah 61:1). . | The intertestamental period (Protestant) or deuterocanonical period (Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) is the period of time between the events of the protocanonical books and the New Testament. Traditionally, it is considered to cover roughly four hundred years, spanning the ministry of Malachi (c. 420 BC) to the appearance of John the Baptist in the early 1st century AD. The biblical apocrypha is written starting 200BC, to this date, the Apocrypha are “included in the lectionaries of Anglican and Lutheran Churches”. During this period the change in common language from Biblical Hebrew to Aramaic and Hellenistic Greek. Biblical Greek or New Testament Greek, was the common supra-regional form of Greek spoken and written during the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. It evolved from the spread of Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, and served as the lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries. Reign of the Hasmonean and Herodian dynasties, followed by Roman rule. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. Herod’s kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE. Because of his failure to properly rule Judea, Archelaus (son of Herod) was removed from his post by Emperor Augustus in 6 CE, while Judea, Samaria and Idumea came under direct Roman administration. . | The New Testament, a new hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see Luke 2:7). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that with His stripes you can be healed (see Isaiah 53:4–5). This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him. . | . Isaiah 53:4-5 4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. . Isaiah 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; . Luke 2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. . How do you say Merry Christmas . One thing we learn from the Old Testament to New Testament transition is that many are waiting or not sure if there was or has been a Messiah. How do you say Merry Christmas? This week I was given a present with a Tree on it and in response to the gift I said “Thank You” and “Merry Christmas”. I was called out! Christmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Even people who don’t worship Jesus as the Son of God can often feel the happiness of Christmas. I received many gifts, few from Christians. .

Additional Christmas Story readings . Those who looked forward to the Savior’s mission. Perhaps, these scriptures will help understand the Wise Men and Journey. Or even understand those still waiting for a Messiah; remember these are people that were captive by Egypt, Babylon, and Rome. . Psalm 35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation. . Isaiah 25:8–9 8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. 9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. . Isaiah 44:21–24 21 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. 22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. 24 Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; . Isaiah 51:11 Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. . Zephaniah 3:14–20; 14 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 15 The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. 16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. 17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. 18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. 19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. 20 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord. . Hope from our 1st Parents . Moses 5:5–11 5 And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. 6 And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me. 7 And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth. 8 Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore. 9 And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will. 10 And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God. 11 And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient. . “His name shall be called Wonderful.” .

Background . Book of Hosea, also spelled Osee, the first of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, considered as one book, The Twelve, in the Jewish canon. According to the superscription, Hosea began his prophetic activity during the reign of Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC). His prophetic announcements indicate that he was active until near the fall (721 BC) of the northern kingdom of Israel, the scene of his entire ministry. The text is quite corrupt and contains difficult problems of interpretation. Yahweh’s compassion for Israel, however, is generally the dominant theme. Having “played the harlot” with Canaanite rites and practices, Israel will surely experience Yahweh’s wrath, but not forever. Yahweh will welcome Israel like a husband who takes back an unfaithful wife. Britannica.com . Book of Joel, second of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets. The Jewish canon lumps all together as The Twelve and divides Joel into four chapters; Christian versions combine chapters 2 and 3. The book relates nothing about Joel except his name and that of his father. An analysis of the text further indicates that Joel lived during the period of the Second Temple of Jerusalem (516 BC–AD 70), for his book reflects the liturgy then in use. Britannica.com .

He accurately foretold the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (although he did not specify Assyria as the cause) and, as a prophet of doom, anticipated later Old Testament prophets. The little that is known about Amos’ life has been gleaned from his book, which was, in all likelihood, partly or wholly compiled by other hands. A native of Tekoa (now a ruin), 12 miles (19 km) south of Jerusalem, Amos flourished during the reigns of King Uzziah (c. 783–742 BC) of Judah (the southern kingdom) and King Jeroboam II (c. 786–746 BC) of Israel. By occupation, he was a shepherd; whether he was merely that or a man of some means is not certain. He actually preached for only a short time. Britannica.com . Book of Obadiah, also spelled Abdias, the fourth of 12 Old Testament books that bear the names of the Minor Prophets, in the Jewish canon treated as one book, The Twelve. Obadiah, with only one chapter consisting of 21 verses, is the shortest of all Old Testament books and purports to be a record of “the vision of Obadiah.” Nothing is known of the prophet except for his name, which means “servant of Yahweh.” In the book, Edom, a long-time enemy of Israel, is castigated for its refusal to help Israel repel foreigners who invaded and conquered Jerusalem. To many scholars this reference suggests a date of composition after the Babylonian conquest of 586 BC. Others, noting the anti-Edomite sentiments in II Kings 8:20–22, consider a date as early as the 9th century BC also probable. Britannica.com . Theme 1: The Lord Reveals Truth Through his Prophets .

In this lesson, students will learn how the spirit of Elijah motivates us to participate in family history work and to become “saviours … on mount Zion” (Obadiah 1:21). | . | 2004 October General Conference closing remarks by Gordon B Hinckley Most of our temples could be much busier than they are. In this noisy, bustling, competitive world, what a privilege it is to have a sacred house where we may experience the sanctifying influence of the Spirit of the Lord. The element of selfishness crowds in upon us constantly. We need to overcome it, and there is no better way than to go to the house of the Lord and there serve in a vicarious relationship in behalf of those who are beyond the veil of death. What a remarkable thing this is. In most cases, we do not know those for whom we work. We expect no thanks. We have no assurance that they will accept that which we offer. But we go, and in that process we attain to a state that comes of no other effort. We literally become saviors on Mount Zion.* What does this mean? Just as our Redeemer gave His life as a vicarious sacrifice for all men, and in so doing became our Savior, even so we, in a small measure, when we engage in proxy work in the temple, become as saviors to those on the other side who have no means of advancing unless something is done in their behalf by those on earth.

Jeremiah cried out to those same people on the brink of that exile and pleaded for their repentance. Lamentations, written by Jeremiah, presents a dirge as Judah went into exile.

And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. the living creature was in the wheels. 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. .

From the lesson . “Commonly translated stick, the Hebrew word used is etz, a generic word meaning ‘wood’ (there are other words meaning ‘stick,’ ‘staff,’ ‘branch,’ or ‘scepter’). This was wood upon which it was possible to write. Babylonian writing tablets of wood have been found hinged together and faced with wax, with writing engraved on them. Two wooden tablets represent the scriptures from Judah (the Bible) and Joseph (the Book of Mormon) to ‘be one in mine hand’ (Ezek. 37:15–19 and fn.)” (A Latter-day Saint Commentary on the Old Testament [1993], 608). | In addition, while serving as an associate professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, Keith Meservy commented on the discovery of some ancient wooden tablets: | “The discovery in 1953 of these writing boards from biblical Calah in Mesopotamia altered the thinking of scholars about how Middle Eastern cultures made records. Wooden tablets filled with wax represent the ‘earliest known form of ancient book’ and help us understand an important prophecy of Ezekiel foretelling the uniting of the Bible and Book of Mormon” (“Ezekiel’s Sticks and the Gathering of Israel,” Ensign, Feb. 1987, 4). | Ezekiel’s prophecy that the two sticks would be joined “one to another into one stick” (Ezekiel 37:17) is clarified by the phrase “shall grow together,” which is found in 2 Nephi 3:12. This phrase helps us understand that the joining together of the two sticks is a process that will occur over time. | Wooden tablets are put together and bound. | . .

Kings confession | New King Darius forced to cast Daniel to the lions by his law. New King after night of fast | . 1. Ye elders of Israel, come join now with me And seek out the righteous, where’er they may be— In desert, on mountain, on land, or on sea— And bring them to Zion, the pure and the free. 2. The harvest is great, and the lab’rers are few; But if we’re united, we all things can do. We’ll gather the wheat from the midst of the tares And bring them from bondage, from sorrows and snares. 3. We’ll go to the poor, like our Captain of old, And visit the weary, the hungry, and cold; We’ll cheer up their hearts with the news that he bore And point them to Zion and life evermore. [Chorus] O Babylon, O Babylon, we bid thee farewell; We’re going to the mountains of Ephraim to dwell. .",

            "content": "Isaiah and Prophesy . The Savior seems to be the center of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (BOM). . Great are the Words of Isaiah: 3 Nephi 23 1-3 | The Prophet Russel M Nelson loves the words of Isaiah, make the Sabbath a Delight: Isaiah 58 13-14 | Our Children need to learn of Isaiah, he talks of the Savior, there are prophesies of today Isaiah talks of Savior: Friend | Isaiah 61 1-3; Luke 4 17-21 | . Gentiles are Part of the Plan . The Gentiles are mentioned frequently. This makes me wonder about… why was it difficult for some of the original apostles when Paul branched out on his Sermons to Gentile lands?. Most of us are Gentiles!!! . Isaiah prophesied of the Gentiles. The Hebrew term goyim translated as “nations” in this passage can mean people in general but is more often translated as “Gentiles” in Isaiah for example, see … . Isaiah 11:10; | 42:1,6; | 49:6, 22; | 54:3; | 60:3, 5, 11, 16. | . Latter-day Saints find a fulfillment of the prophecy that Gentile nations shall flow unto the mountain of the Lord as they witness individuals and families from nations around the world enter temples to worship and receive temple ordinances. . It probably never occurred to Isaiah’s contemporaries that this prophecy spoke of Gentile nations actually building, entering, and ministering in the temple. | . . Temples and Gentiles are part of the Prophesy . Let’s think of counsel from the Prophet and Apostles from Conference in reference to Isaiah 56. Study talks by scholars on Isaiah and Temples: . Temples and Isaiah | Isaiah 56:1-2, 7-8 | . Chapter 56 of Isaiah seems to offer some clarification on the issue of Gentiles and Temple worship and perhaps offer some indication that someday that Gentiles could actually enter in the temple. . After admonishing the covenant people to “Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed” (56:1) | The Lord pronounces a blessing on those who follow his commandments, keep the Sabbath, and avoid doing evil (see 56:2). | .

Our Prophet opened the morning sessions stating . Godly power comes into the world with each new temple | . Find a Reference in Isaiah . Sunday morning talks were amazing to me. These talks reminded me of Isaiah, which was “my ask” during conference. Below are my notes from the talks as I listened. Look at these talks or others, extract a quote or topic then find it in Isaiah, See if this helps you, as it did me, to hear the voice of the prophets past and present. . Russel M Nelson : &quot;Isaiah, Covenants or Heavenly Power or Rest&quot; . We are constantly on the Prophets mind. He weeps over our heartaches.

Some leave Church because it requires too much. But, look for “rest”. Washington DC temple open house. Temple journey shows symbolism. A boy pointed to alter as a place of rest on temple journey.

The Eternal Family Teaching Manual: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/the-eternal-family-teacher-manual/lesson-14-becoming-saviors-on-mount-zion?lang=eng . Isaiah is hard to Read . Isaiah is trying to help you visualize a scene, like a movie director. Isaiah is Poetry. Slow down, decompose the words. Look at other translations. Notice that the King James Version (KJV) does not show the poetic lines, but The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) does. Here are some comparisons of literary styles . . Types of Parallelism . Synonymous—Often the second line will help explain the first. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:31 | . 31 The strong shall become like tinder, and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them. . Emblematic—Ideas are compared by means of simile or metaphor. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:18 | . 18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. . Antithetic—The second line clarifies both ideas through contrast, like the color black next to white. . Example: NRSV Isa 1:19–20 | . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken . Synthetic or Completion—The second line completes the first, like a belt and buckle, in the form of . Question–Answer, or | Situation–Consequence, or | Proposition–Conclusion. | . Example: NSRV Isa 1:19 . 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; . Chiasmus or Introverted—This word comes from Greek letter Χ (chi), which is the form it describes. The second line of the parallel is inverted. (Note: Often a chiasmus has many more than four lines.) . Example: NIV Isa 11:1 | . A) A shoot will come up B) from the stump of Jesse; B’) from his roots A’) a Branch will bear fruit. . Composite—each word or phrase (usually three or more) presents or expands upon a common theme, like spokes in a wheel. . Example: NSRV Isa 1:4 | . 4 Ah, sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, offspring who do evil, children who deal corruptly, who have forsaken the LORD, who have despised the Holy One of Israel, who are utterly estranged! . Climatic— Part of one line is treated in subsequent lines, culminating (or sometimes beginning) with the main point. . Example A (ending with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:7 | . 7 Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners. . Example B (beginning with the main point): NSRV Isa 1:8 | . 8. And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city. .",

How Great Thou Art . I struggle with pure Psalm reading, so I am always looking for new connections. As I make these connections, my perspective on reading Psalms begins to change. Not by just through reading, but by trying to connect to them in other ways. In Sabre Spring history, one Sunday, we had Alex Boye visit us and proclaim and testify of this Psalm/Hymn. As he sings, imagine this at our chapel pulpit. Also, follow along with the words on the page. Compare with the Psalm, Alex Boye accompanied by Mark Smith. .

What does this theme me to you? | Focus in on the image of Job talking to friends. Can you make any connections with trials and talking to friends? | . . Job Part 1: Tragedy of Job . Job is a life known for overcoming trials. . Job 1:3… His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. | Job 1:6-12, according to authors, the Lord and Satan had a chat. Satan was given permission to inflict Job with hardships. | Job 1:14-19 the hardships start to happen. Theatrical adaptation to these versus in our reading. After each hardship we will have a (reporter) and the save (survivor) who says… “I only am escaped alone to tell thee”. | . 1st reporter … The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 2nd reporter … The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 3rd reporter … The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. . | 4th reporter … Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. | survivor … I only am escaped alone to tell thee. | . That is a lot to deal with, fortune and family in a seemingly short period of time. . Job Part 2: Recovery of Job . Job 2-41 is a whole bunch of poetry. More on the lamenting, and praising in the these books of Job is below. | Job 42:10,12-13,16 in the end, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. Except children seem the same (why not twice as many children?) And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. | So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. | He had also seven sons and three daughters. | After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. | . | . Conversation between the Lord and Satan . The conversations between the Lord and Satan in the book of Job are presented in a poetic narrative that emphasizes Satan’s role as our adversary. . A former Lesson plan speaks about reading Job 1:6-12 in the roles of (Narrator, the Lord, and Satan). Let’s do it! | . The Script . Narrator: Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Whence comest thou? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? . | Narrator: Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, | Satan: Doth Job fear God for nought? | Satan: Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. | Satan: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. . | Narrator: And the Lord said unto Satan, | Lord: Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. . | Narrator: So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. | . The narrative indicates that Satan goes forward and inflicts trials on Job. Satan is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary”; these verses in Job 1 use the form hassatan, meaning “the adversary,” which describes the satan’s role here. . Much of this could be illustrative for us, as the reader. | The books theme is eternal problem of unmerited suffering. | Any thoughts on this dialog? What do we think about it doctrinally? | . Background on the Book of Job . More on the Book of Job The book of Job has received much literary acclaim. | Why do the righteous suffer? | Questions arise, was Job and actual man? In scripture Job was an actual man and is referred to as a great prophet… Noah, Daniel, and Job exhibited great righteousness. | Ancient Jewish tradition claims that the book of Job was written by Moses before writing the Pentateuch (five books of Moses). Perhaps as old as 1800 B.C. | How old was Job when he died? | . | . Reading Poetry in the Old Testament . I think Old Testament books when you get to Job and beyond are hard to read. The style changes to poetry and the expression of deep feelings. While we are reading we are experiencing and thinking across boundaries ot time. Boundaries of perspectives. Come Follow me has an inserted section stating.. - Repetition of thoughts, parallelism, poetry - Hebrew language, different culture, different thoughts - According to my analytics Worm / Worms has 11 references in Job. Huh, worms!, Job 25:6 . Tennyson has been quoted as stating that the book of Job is “the greatest poem of ancient or modern times.” Of course, Tennyson was a poet… . And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers, &quot;&#39;Tis the fairy Lady of Shalott.&quot; . I am not Tennyson, but a Computer Scientist. Thus, I need to slow down with poetry. Fast with Code, but poetry requires cross references for me to see all the BITS of wisdom. You must analyze each word in the STANZA,POEM,DOGGEREL,CODE 😀. . Job 14:14-15 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. | Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. | . | Doctrine in Covenants 29:43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation—that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; | . | Mosiah 16:8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ. | He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. | Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil— | If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation | . | . My Top 4 poetic perspectives from Job . Job as indicated by picture is in dialog with his friends for the majority of the book of Job. For me, over the years I have highlighted a few items.

New Testament 1st and 2nd Great Commandments: Mark 12:30, 31 | Hyrum Smith cleave and commandments: D&amp;C 11:19-21 | Love God through Jesus our mediator: John 14:6-7 | May 2022 Stake fireside we had Terryl and Fiona Givens, they spoke of the “The Healing Truths of the Restoration”. Their topics began with our understanding of God. A lot of their talk is supplemented by early Christian thinkers. These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted my re-understanding and my relationship with God … Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. … my interpretation, the First Estate Additional notes: God character, perfection, and attributes according to Origen, more generous than we can imagine. Co-existent with God, The Creation. | . | Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/ c. 130 – c. 202 AD) “Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice.” … my interpretation, everyone will be taught of the role of Jesus Christ in our eternal plan. Additional notes: God is collaborative in other words we participate. Moses 7:29 Enoch ask how can God weep. God is weeping, while seeing his children suffer. This is a reformation of how we should view God, merciful and kind. Macrina The advance of the soul is through God’s love. Julian of Norwich And I was answered in my understanding: ‘It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.’ In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it. | . | Universalism, the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions … In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God … my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity. Edward Beecher,Satan is trying to destroy true nature of God and the Plan. | . | . | President Nelson Choices for Eternity First, know the truth about who you are. If Lord were to speak to you today… He would make sure you understand is your true identity. I am simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.” | Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you…. In short, They have offered you everything! God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you. | And third, know the truth related to your conversion. The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you. Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life. You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe. | . | For those that have experience with the Temple… What is the focus of the Temple in our relationship with God? Understanding our relationship with God? Understanding the nature of God? How do we learn to love the Lord through the temple? | History, Stories, and Miracles in Joshua and Judges . As I read these stories, I often want to know more about the archeology, history, and details that verify these events. Things like the Ark of the Covenant, the Levite Priests, the Bugles, and the “facts’ around them are fascinating to me. Usually, I think about Indiana Jones when I think of the Ark and this fantasy leads me to Wikipedia and its linked sources to explore and Journey into the past. Here are the stories that fascinate me… . Children of Israel Cross Jordan Joshua 3:13,15,17 | The Walls of Jericho Joshua 6:2-6, 6:20 | Ambush at Ai, Joshua 6:14-21 | Trumpets and Lights of Gideon versus the Midianites Judges 7:16,20-21 | Samson and Delilah, is this scripture/history? Judges 16 | *** Why did the children of Israel keep falling int idolatry aka People after Gideon I have heard it said that our children today have such a hard time, I have seen it and felt it personally. This goes to them “Lest we Forget” . As far as evidences of these stories, there are as many opportunities to believe or doubt, even the Children of Israel doubted. Here are some things that we should understand as we read these stories… . These books belong to the tradition of Jewish history and law, called Deuteronomic, they were first committed to writing about 550 BCE, during the Babylonian Exile. The Book of Ezra is contemporary with this time of this compilation. For reference, the time period of Joshua is closer to 1400 BCE. | The death of Moses is recorded in Deuteronomy 34, the death of Joshua is recorded in the book of Joshua 24. Many of the events we have today were created from either oral histories or fragments. | Scholars, Archeologists and others often differ in opinion on cities like Jericho and Ai and how their destructions reconcile with being at the time of Joshua. | Come Follow Me suggests finding gems. It describes these books as being referred to as “Historical” portions of the Old Testament. Thus, some of these stories can be gruesome, troubling, or just from a single perspective. Come Follow Me Source: Thoughts to Keep in Mind | Be aware that Joseph Smith and his work on the Bible. The big changes in Joshua are referring to the “True Attributes of God”. The Contribution of the JST to the Old Testament Historical Books The KJV reads, “For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly” (Joshua 11:20). The Prophet changed it to read, “For it was of the Lord to destroy them utterly because they hardened their hearts.” | . | The Story of Rahab . Joshua 2 Before the Israelites cross the Jordan, Joshua sends men to scout out the land. Arriving in Jericho, they decide to spend the night at the house of the harlot Rahab. When Jericho’s ruler tries to apprehend them, Rahab hides them and then helps them escape, thus saving their lives. In return, she and her household are spared the destruction of Jericho and Rahab and her family become part of the people Israel. . Rehab’s Purpose . Rahab’s Faith, Works . Rahab in the ancestry of Jesus . My interpretation of Rahab’s example… God saves, atones and loves those with a past. Brother Darcy provided amazing insight on his feelings into this atoning process. He understood that in his work in education within the prison he saw hunger, compared to his work in traditional work in education where he sees complacency and a focus on credit hours. Lives are often best changed with a reawakening, we don’t necessarily need to be a harlot or be in prison, but whatever prison we shackle upon ourself, we need to awaken unto God and use the quickening power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. .",

            "content": "Easter, The Atonement of Jesus Christ . He Lives. Today we stand as witnesses of Jesus Christ, of his Resurrection, and the fulfillment of the Atonement. . | Josiah Drew on Good Friday and our experience Friday under full moon in Laguna Mountains and Kitchen Creek . | Jesus Lives . | Insights from Tad Callister on “The Infinite Atonement” coupled with Come Follow Me “Though His Atonement” scriptures . Satan has been successful in diverting much of the Christian world’s attention from the one doctrine that can save us, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, to the ancillary doctrines that have meaning only because they draw their sustenance from this redeeming event. Like a skilled magician, Satan’s every move is to divert our attention and dilute our focus from the primary object at hand, namely Christ’s atoning sacrifice, in hopes we will turn exclusively to doctrines of secondary and far lesser import” (page 15). | “In the pre-mortal council the Savior covenanted with the Father to perform the Atonement. . . Based on that pledge or covenant we had faith in him. Based on that covenant the Father could promise remission of sins prior to the atoning sacrifice because he “knew” his Son would not fail. The issue was not that he could not break his covenant, but rather, that he would not” (page 74). Abraham 3 read verse 24. 25, 27. | So what is the Atonement, and why was the Fall of Adam and Eve so significant, even vital? Eve Moses 5:9–12, Were it not for our transgression… We never should have had seed | Never should have known good and evil | The joy of our redemption | The eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient | | Elder Callister state the purposes of the Atonement … To restore all that was lost in physical and spiritual death | To provide the opportunity to repent and overcome spiritual death | To allow us the potential to become a god or goddess. | | . | “The Savior observed every spiritual law with undeviating exactness apparently because of his compliance with each one, he received power upon power until he acquired the attributes of God, even in premortal ties. Such progress was a natural consequence of his exacting compliance. His godhood thus seemed to result not from a creation of these laws, but rather from compliance with them” (page 301). Moroni 10:32:33 shares how we become holy and without spot, which is the covenatn of the Father through Christ. | It is infinite in the blessings it bestows. The blessings of the Atonement extend far beyond its well-known triumph over physical and spiritual death. Some of these blessings overlap; some complement and supplement each other; but in the aggregate the effect of this event so blesses our lives in a multiplicity of ways, both known and yet to be discovered, that it might appropriately be said to be infinite in its blessing nature” (page 60). Romans 8:35-39 in life or death nothing shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. | “One does not speak lightly of the Atonement or casually express his appreciation. It is the most sacred and sublime event in eternity. It deserves our most intense thoughts, our most profound feelings, and our noblest deeds. One speaks of it in reverential tones; one contemplates it in awe; one learns of it in solemnity. This event stands alone, now and throughout eternity. . . . “I now add my testimony to the many who have preceded me that his sacrifice was indeed an infinite and eternal Atonement” (pages 334-335). Doctrine &amp; Convenants 19:15-19 I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men. | . | Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness By Sharon Eubank . Christ heals wounds. When tragedies overtake us, when life hurts so much we can’t breathe, when we’ve taken a beating like the man on the road to Jericho and been left for dead, Jesus comes along and pours oil into our wounds, lifts us tenderly up, takes us to an inn, looks after us. To those of us in grief, He says, “I will … ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, … that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.” | Christ is rest. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said: “It is not intended that we run faster than we have strength. … But [in spite of] that, I know … many of you run [very,] very fast and that [the] energy and emotional supply sometimes registers close to empty.” When expectations overwhelm us, we can step back and ask Heavenly Father what to let go of. Part of our life experience is learning what not to do. But even so, sometimes life can be exhausting. Jesus assures us, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Christ is willing to join with us in the yoke and pull in order to lighten our burdens. | The Lord knows how hard you are trying. You are making progress. Keep going. He sees all your hidden sacrifices and counts them to your good and the good of those you love. Your work is not in vain. You are not alone. His very name, Emmanuel, means “God with us.” He is surely with you. | Christ sees us in our tree. For various reasons, we don’t feel accepted or acceptable. The New Testament shows the great efforts Jesus made to reach out to all kinds of people: lepers, tax collectors, children, Galileans, harlots, women, Pharisees, sinners, Samaritans, widows, Roman soldiers, adulterers, the ritually unclean. In almost every story, He is reaching someone who wasn’t traditionally accepted in society. Luke 19 tells the story of the chief tax collector in Jericho named Zacchaeus. He climbed a tree in order to see Jesus walk by. Zacchaeus was employed by the Roman government and viewed as corrupt and a sinner. Jesus saw him up in the tree and called to him, saying, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.” And when Jesus saw the goodness of Zacchaeus’s heart and the things he did for others, He accepted his offering, saying, “This day is salvation come to this house, [for] he also is a son of Abraham.” | . | .",

Cook 5 highlights First Love God - Post WWII by George Albet Smith, “reminded the Saints of the Savior’s invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies”. What do we think today as Russia invades Ukraine? Elder Holland, there is a quote that says “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” | Second Seek the Fruits of the Spirit - “will pitch our tents toward the temple”. This was reference to Lot and Abraham actions after parting ways and dividing land. In adversity, how do we avoid resentment? avoid the false coping strategies? | Third Excercise Agency to Choose Righteousness - “agency is at the heart of personal growth and experience”. How do we act in challenge? “all that is unfair in life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ”. My heart mourns for post missionary service and those that feel like they can’t recover from failing in their agency. Or members, who ultimately get to the Temple and suffer because of post Temple covenant breaking. My Testimony, I have experienced problems in my personal agencency because of “unfair circumstances”. Things can be made right throught the atonement. | Fourth Build Zion in our Hearts and Homes - “religious observance can “unleash the power of families … to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith.” I believe the pandemic was an opportunity for the Church to follow the prophet on “home-centered, church-supported religous observance”. As I have returned to school and have sat in equity, avoiding microagressions, and all lives matter type of meetings … It is my opinion, that our tolerance and love needs to increase, but also are covenant observance needs to be able to withstand all. I believe we live in a time similar to when Abraham was looking for 50 great souls to unite with him in faith and with God. Ultimately he could only could worship as a family. | Fifth Follow the Current Admonitions of Our Prophet - “feel enduring peace and joy, even in turbulent times”. I find it intrguing that Elder Cook says “Current Admonitions”. In turbulant time we don’t want to be Lot’s wife, perhaps that could be looking back at old admonitions by old prophets. Also, we need to feel joy and look ahead. Thoughts? | . |",

Thus, the need to get the plates. | . | What do the scriptures say about time of creation and genealogy of man? The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke… Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph’s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli. These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD. According to genealogies many biblical purest say Adam is 6000-10000 years old. | 2 Peter 3:8 … one day is with the Lord as a thousand years … | Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days … And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time. … | D&amp;C 77:6 speaks of temporal existence … the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence… W. W. Phelps calculation “Though 7000 Earth years is in conflict with all physical, chemical, genetic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence, 7000 years of God is not ruled out. The arithmetic is easy. One day of God is 1000 years of man, and therefore in Joseph Smith’s reckoning, a day of God is 365 × 1000 days of man.” Multiply that by 7000 and you get 2.556 billion years. | . | . Revelation continues, Restoration continues . Everyone will always be left to grapple between Wisdom of the World versus Wisdom of God. But the Gospel and Faith enable us to obtain continuous and pertinent revelation, even enlightenment if we study and ask. There are four accounts of creation in our scriptures 3 accounts, plus the temple. Abraham account says … ““We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.” | Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.) | Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed. | Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fullness. | In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man … And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth … Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men. | . | .",

God the Father has given us the divine birth, the incomparable life, and the infinite atoning sacrifice of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. By the power of the Father, Jesus rose again and gained the victory over death. He is our Savior, our Exemplar, and our Redeemer. . Child of God . I have a story. My story is that I came to earth; just like everyone that has lived, is living, or will live. We all share an earthly experience. My excitement, to this story, is that I am a child of God. That my birth, entitled me to a divine spirit! I believe we all have that spirit and it directs us in every major decision and thought. In my 18th year, I became converted to tuning into my divine potential. Shortly after, my 19th year, two years were spent serving the people of England. There were many days walking down roads unknown and several opportunities to teach others something familiar, that “God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the “restitution of all things” as foretold in the Bible. In his vision, Joseph learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christ’s New Testament Church was lost from the earth. Joseph would be instrumental in its return”. I became increasingly aware that Jesus Christ lives as I taught of these restoring truths and observing others tuning into their divine spirit. Today, 40+ years later, I continue proclaim that same witnesses and that same spirit truth resides within each of us. . Continue in Faith . I have had 5 wonderful children. My 1st wife I met at Catalina Island, for both of us it was a love at first site experience. We framed our life on following the Savior, fighting her cancer, and adopting children. Tamara left this earth at age 42. My first 3 children and I survived, but suffered. In my darkest moments, I felt the presence of the Savior. I had a visit from Jesus in my dreams and he presented to me that my deceased wife Tamara had risen, as well as certain ancestors gone before. At that time, I needed the comfort of these tender and miraculous experiences. After two years as a single dad, it was time for a new event in my life … I remember looking across the Celestial room in the San Diego Temple and seeing someone familiar, Lora. Once again, love returned to my life, it came with a blended family, and my first biological son. As with Job in the Old Testament, in adversity “I know that my redeemer lives” and that “the latter end of my life has more than my beginning”. Through all, there has been a clarity that Jesus Lives, many divine connections, and always a continuing faith as child of God. .",
